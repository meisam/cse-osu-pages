Some notes about homework #3.


h2(#Q1). Question 1 <a name="Q1"></a>

* A DFA does not have any transition labeled λ. If you have a λ transition, your answer is wrong.
* Each state in a DFA over an alphabet with _n_ symbols has exactly _n_ outgoing transitions. If for any state you do not have exactly two outgoing transitions, your answer is wrong.

h3(#Q1c). Part C

The DFA shown below was a *COMMON MISTAKE*. This DFA does not accept 01 which is a string in the language, neither does it accept 0101 (and 010101 and ...).

h2(#Q2). Question 2

h3. Part A

The question explicitly asks you to give a D.F.A. with  _only four states_.

h3. Part B

One of the possible answers is (00+11+(10+01)(11+00)[^*^](10+01))[^*^].
*Common Mistake:* Note that (00+11+0101+0110+1001+1010)[^*^] does NOT generate strings like 101101 which are in the language.
