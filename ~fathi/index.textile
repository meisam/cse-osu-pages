I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the Ohio State University. My research interests are programming languages and compilers, particularly, I'm interested in automatic analysis of programs for detecting bugs. During my master studies, I was working on using static analysis techniques for detecting bugs. Now, I am working on dynamic analysis techniques for detecting bugs in concurrent programs under the supervision of "Dr. Michael Bond":http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mikebond in the "Programming Languages and Software Systems (PLaSS) Group":http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mikebond/plass/.
