You can find more detailed information and the answers to some of the questions below.

h2(#Q1). Question 1

h3. Notes

* For each part, you will lose one point if your proof has a subtle flaw. 
* For part ==(c)==, you should show that there exist an __i__ such that __uv[^i^]w__ is neither is __0[^n^]1[^n^]__ nor __0[^n^]1[^2n^]__. If you do not show this, you'll lose 1 point. If you have both "Let __x = 0[^n^]1[^n^]__" and "Let __x = 0[^n^]1[^2n^]__" in your answer to prove that this language is not regular, then you are trying to prove it twice!   
* Generally we do not know the values for __u__, __v__, and __w__. Consequently, if __n__ is the number given by the Pumping Lemma and you have sentences such as __u__=__a[^n^]__ in your answer, you probably need to review the Pumping Lemma.

h2(#Q2). Question 2

**Part (i):** Consider these languages: __L[~i~]__ = {all non prime numbers} âˆª {all prime numbers less than __i__ }
