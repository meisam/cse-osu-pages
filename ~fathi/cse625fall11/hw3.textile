Some notes about homework #3.

h2(#Q1). Question 1 <a name="Q1"></a>

* A DFA does not have any transition labeled λ. If you have a λ transition, your answer is wrong.
* Each state in a DFA over an alphabet with _n_ symbols has exactly _n_ outgoing transitions. If for any state you do not have exactly two outgoing transitions, your answer is wrong.

h3(#Q1c). Part C

The DFA shown below was a *COMMON MISTAKE*. This DFA does not accept 01 which is a string in the language, neither does it accept 0101 (and 010101 and ...).

h2(#Q2). Question 2

h3. Part A

The question explicitly asks you to give a D.F.A. with  _only four states_.
!hw3-q2-a.gif(An automata that accepts strings with even number of 0's and even number of 1's)! 

h3. Part B

One of the possible answers is (00+11+(10+01)(11+00)[^*^](10+01))[^*^].
*Common Mistake:* Note that (00+11+0101+0110+1001+1010)[^*^] does NOT generate strings like 101101 which are in the language.

h2(#Q3). Question 3

It seems that question was somehow vague because many students didn't understand what this question really wants. In your future assignments, if you don't know what a question actually wants, please ask me.

h3. Answers

*Part ==(a)==:* The set of all languages with a finite number of strings (elements).
*Part ==(b)==:*  The set of all languages whose strings are of length at most one.
*Part ==(c)==:* The set of all languages that contain at most one string.

h3. Notes

* The Kleene operation cannot be emulated by the union operation. If _A_ and _B_ are two finite languages, their union is still a finite language. But the Kleene closure of a finite language can be infinite.
* All the above languages contain the base language which means they contain _ϕ_ and {λ}.
* I've seen phrases such as "languages over Σ ∪ {λ}" or "languages over {Σ} ∪ {λ}". These are wrong because an alphabet cannot contain λ.
* All finite languages are regular (why?). So a phrases such as "The set of all finate regular languages" is redundant (but it is wrong).

h2(#Q4). Question 4

h3. Answer

==|==F[~173~]==|== is finite and is an even number. It is finite because the number of DFAs that can be construct by __n__ states is finite and each DFA is equivalent to one and only one language. It is even because for any DFA with n states that accepts __L__, you can construct another DFA that accepts the compliment of __L__ by changing the accepting states to rejecting and visa versa.

h3. Notes

Many of you tried to find the exact value of ==|==F[~173~]==|==. This needs answering at least three other sub-questions:
# In how many ways can we assign accepting/rejecting states to the DFA.
# In how many different ways can we assign transition to states?.
# In how many ways can we specify the initial state in a DFA with __n__ states?

If you have shown the answer to the first sub-question is an even number, you will get the full scores for this question (regardless of your answer to the second and third sub-question).

h2(#Q5). Question 5

h3. Notes

For the new DFA you should specify the set of states, the set of final state, the start state, and the transition function.

h2(#Q6). Question 6

h3. Answers

# {2,3,5}
# {1,2,5}
# {1,2,3,4,5}
# {3,5}
# {1,2,4,5}
# {1,2,3,4,5}
