If your answer is "False" and you provide a counterexample and you claim that the counter example is not equivalent to any sh=1 expression but you do not prove your claim, you will get 4 points.You will get 8 point if you provide a counterexample and prove that your example cannot be rewritten with sh = 1, but your prove is not complete or is fallacious "subtly". Finally, you will get 12 points if you provide a counterexample and prove that your example cannot be re-written with sh = 1.
