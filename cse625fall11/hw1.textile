*Question 1* has 5 points.
*Question 2* has 15 points (5 points for each part). 
*Question 3* has 5 points. Not that you won't get any points unless you provide a counterexample that shows sometimes |A||B| is not equal to |AB|.
*Question 4* has 15 points (5 points for each part).
*Question 5* has 25 points (5 points for each part)
*Question 6* has 25 points (5 point for each part)
